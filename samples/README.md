# Bring Your Own Job Sample

This sample demonstrates how to start jobs using your own script, packaged in a SageMaker-compatible container, using the Amazon AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK) service controller for Amazon SageMaker.                     

## Prerequisites    

This sample assumes that you have already configured an EKS cluster with the ACK operator. It also assumes that you have installed `kubectl` - you can find a link on our [installation page](To do).

### Creating your first Job

The easiest way to start is taking a look at the sample training jobs and its corresponding [README](/samples/training/README.md)
